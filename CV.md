Projects
--------

* Studytrip to St. Petersburg (Russia) (*September 2015-May 2016*)
  * Along with seven other committee members, I organized a study trip for 49 people to St. Petersburg (Russia), that took place 12-17 April 2016. The trip consisted of activities that stimulated the participant to become more aware of cultural differences between the West and Russia. Moreover, the trip contributed to the personal and group development within the Outreaching Honors Program. The organization consisted of setting up contracts, collecting personal contributions, booking flight tickets, and accommodation, applying for visas and coordinating activities.

* Get it Together (*May 2015-May 2016*)
  * Get it Together was a Community Project stimulated by the Outreaching Honors Program. The project was set up by a multidisciplinary team of students with the ambition to encourage sharing in the local community of Tilburg. On top of starting new projects, we tried to promote existing sharing initiatives in Tilburg such as FoodSharing, KONNEKTid and the Deelwinkel of Nijmegen. This promotion has consisted of updating social media (Facebook \& Twitter) and the distribution of flyers and stickers, with a logo that was designed by me personally.

* OLab: Future of Elderly Care (*October 2014-May 2015*)
  * The Outreaching Lab “Future of Elderly Care: Culture” was a research project conducted in a multidisciplinary team led by prof. Gerard van Oortmerssen. The project aimed at creating a framework to deal with future organizational cultural changes in Dutch nursing homes. These changes are predicted to arise due to population ageing, rapid innovation and financial cutbacks. In the future, the role of both the elderly and their family in day-to-day care is expected to increase, with the help of technology presenting itself as a secondary solution. Theoretical research and semi-structured interviews were used to give advice to Avoord Zorg \& Wonen.

* OLab: Tax Nudging (*November 2015-May 2016*)
  * Outreaching Lab “Tax Nudging” was a research project conducted in a multidisciplinary team led by prof. Hans Gribnau. The goal of this project was to find out which type of "nudge" would be most effective in order for people to fill in their tax return with greater accuracy, a higher rate of completion, and in a timely fashion. Nudging is a concept that changes the behavior of people, without restricting their choices. General examples include the placement of fruit on eye-level and the default <font face=symbol>¢</font>yes<font face=symbol>¢</font> option in the organ donor register. We used theoretical research and a self-designed survey to reach a conclusion. In the survey participants were confronted with different types of nudges, such as a personal email from the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) or a pre-filled tax return. The effectiveness of the different nudges was measured on a Likert scale. Our analysis concluded that out of the proposed nudges, two types were most effective. These were the personal email from the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration and a checklist that shows which information still needs to be sent in.
